# Active Speaker States

You can access the volume of every user in the room. In store `peerId` is mapped with the volume of the user. You can use this to show the volume of the user in the room. We have also added a new state `activeSpeaker` which will be updated with the `peerId` of the active speaker in the room.

### States

```typescript
type IActiveSpeakerState {
    dominantSpeaker: string;
    peerIdToVolume: Record<string, number>;
}
```

- `dominantSpeaker` - `peerId` of the active speaker in the room.
- `peerIdToVolume` - `peerId` mapped with the volume of the user.

### Example

You can access the room state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.

```tsx

import { useHuddleStore } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

interface Props {
    peerId: string;
}

const Component = ({ peerId }) => {
    const activeSpeakerPeerId = useHuddleStore((state) => state.activeSpeaker);

    return (
        <div>
            {peerId === activeSpeakerPeerId && <div>Active Speaker</div>}
            ...
        <div />
    )
}
```

> **NOTE:** Doing this will subscribe activeSpeaker state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes.
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
