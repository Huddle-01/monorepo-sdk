# Host Controls States

The general architecture of the meeting gives certain powers to the host to moderate the meeting. You can have one host and multiple co-hosts.

The host has the powers to make other peers co-hosts and remove them. Other host powers include

- Restrict access to the chat
- Start and stop recording
- Start and stop live streaming
- Start and stop screen sharing
- Stop video
- Stop audio
- Start and stop the meeting

### Store States

```tsx
type IHostControlsStoreType {
  hostId: string | null;
  hostState: IHostState;
  meId: string;
  coHosts: string[];
  hostControl: THostControls;
}

type THostControls = {
  allowVideo: boolean;
  allowAudio: boolean;
  allowScreenShare: boolean;
  allowChat: boolean;
};

export type IHostState = 'host-false' | 'host-true' | 'no-host';
```

- `hostId` is the id of the host
- `hostState` is the state of the host
- `meId` is the id of the current user
- `coHosts` is an array of co-hosts
- `hostControl` is an object that contains the host controls

`THostControls`

- `allowVideo` is a boolean that determines if the host allows video
- `allowAudio` is a boolean that determines if the host allows audio
- `allowScreenShare` is a boolean that determines if the host allows screen sharing
- `allowChat` is a boolean that determines if the host allows chat

`IHostState`

- `host-false` is the state when the host is not in the room
- `host-true` is the state when the host is in the room
- `no-host` is the state when there is no host in the room

### Example

**You can access the room state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.**

To access the data of each peer in the room, you must have access to the `peerId` of that peer.

```jsx
import { useHuddleStore } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

interface Props {
    peerId: string;
}

const Component = ({ peerId }) => {
    const hostId = useHuddleStore(state => state.hostId);

    return (
        <div>
            {isCamPaused === peerId ? "Host" : "Not Host"}
            ...
        <div />
    )
}

```

> **NOTE: Doing this will subscribe `hostId` state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes**. <br />
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
