# User Store States

User Store or generally called `me` store. contains all the states of the current joined user client. It is a special store that is not shared with other peers. It is a store that is only available to the current user.

### Me Store States

```typescript
type MeState = {
    peerId: string;
    displayName: string;
    avatarUrl: string;
    isSharePaused: boolean;
    isCamPaused: boolean;
    isMicPaused: boolean;
    reaction: string;
}
```

`peerId` is the unique id of the current user.<br />
`displayName` is the display name of the current user.<br />
`avatarUrl` is the avatar url of the current user.<br />
`isSharePaused` is the state of the screen share of the current user.<br />
`isCamPaused` is the state of the camera of the current user.<br />
`isMicPaused` is the state of the microphone of the current user.<br />
`reaction` is the reaction of the current user.<br />

### Example

**You can access the room state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.**

```jsx
import { useHuddleStore } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

const App = () => {
    const peerId = useHuddleStore(state => state.peerId);

    return (
        <Component>
            peerId: {peerId}
            ...
        <Component />
    )
}

```

> **NOTE: Doing this will subscribe `peerId` state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes**. <br />
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
