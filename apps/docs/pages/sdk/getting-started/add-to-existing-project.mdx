# Add Huddle01 to an Existing Project

---

Huddle01 can be easily integrated to any existing project to leverage the infrastructure of our platform. This guide will walk you through the steps to add Huddle01 to your application.
We provide you with client functions to build a robust and secure connection to the Huddle01 platform. The client functions are available in the [client-methods](/docs/web-sdk/methods) section.

## Prerequisites

You must have an **API Key** to access the Huddle01 Infrastructure.

> [Get your API Key here](/docs/web-sdk/api-key)

You must have the latest version of `Nodejs` installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of `Nodejs` from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Dependencies

Install the `huddle01-client` package using the following command:

```bash
## npm
npm install --save @huddle01/huddle01-client
## yarn
yarn add @huddle01/huddle01-client
```

## Usage

The `huddleClient` is the root class of the SDK. It is used to access all the fetaures of the SDK.
To initialize the HuddleClient Class in your project `getHuddleClient` function provided inside the module must be used.

Replace _Your-API-Key_ with the key generated [here](/docs/web-sdk/api-key)

```jsx
//src/App.tsx
import { getHuddleClient } from '@huddle01/huddle01-client';

const huddleClient = getHuddleClient('Your-API-Key');
```

> **Note:** The `HuddleClient` is a singleton class so you should only have one instance of it in your project.
> If you want to use the `HuddleClient` in multiple places in your project, you should import it from a single file.
> This will ensure that you are using the same instance of the `HuddleClient` everywhere.

## Initialize the HuddleClient

To enable all the features of the SDK, You should wrap your project with the `HuddleProvider` component.
The `HuddleClientProvider` is a wrapper component for the `HuddleClient` class. It is used to provide the `HuddleClient` instance to all the child components in the project.

```jsx
//src/App.tsx
import { HuddleClientProvider, getHuddleClient } from '@huddle01/huddle01-client';

const App = () => {
  const huddleClient = getHuddleClient('<Your-API-Key>')
  return (
    <HuddleClientProvider client = {huddleClient} >
      <YourApp>
        ...
      </YourApp>
    </HuddleClientProvider>
  );
};
```

> **Note:** The `HuddleClientProvider` should be the root component of your project.
> It should wrap all the other components in your project. You can use the `HuddleClientProvider` in any component in your project.
> But it is recommended that you use it in the root component of your project.

And that's it! You have successfully integrated the Huddle01 SDK to your project.

## Using the HuddleClient

As mentioned above, the `HuddleClient` is the root class of the SDK. It exposes several methods to access the features of the SDK.
For example, to join a room you can use the `join` method of the `HuddleClient` class.

```jsx
huddleClient.join('roomId');
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have successfully integrated the Huddle01 SDK to your project, you can start using the SDK to build your own features.

Check out [Client Methods](/docs/web-sdk/methods) to learn more about how to invoke different `HuddleClient` methods to build your own features.
