# Room States

Room is the entity that stores the meeting details, Every peer connects to a room to enable the meeting.
Room has a unique ID named `roomId`, which is used to identify the room.

### States

```typescript
type IRoomState = {
  roomId: string;
  joined: boolean;
  droppedState: {
    type: IDropReason; // left, timeout, kicked, unhandled, not-joined, denied, closedByHost
    isDropped: boolean;
  };
  createdAt: number;
  isRoomLocked: boolean;
};
```

`roomId` is the unique ID of the room.<br />
`joined` is a boolean value that indicates whether the peer has joined the room or not.<br />
`droppedState` is an object that contains the reason for the peer to leave the room.<br />
`createdAt` is the timestamp when the room was created.<br />
`isRoomLocked` is a boolean value that indicates whether the room is locked or not.<br />

> **NOTE:** All the above values are inside the object `roomState` and needs to accessed from there

<br />

This is very important state, as it indicates the reason for the peer to leave the room.
it can be one of the following values:

- `left`: Peer left the room.
- `timeout`: Peer timed out.
- `kicked`: Peer was kicked out of the room.
- `unhandled`: Peer was disconnected due to an unhandled error.
- `not-joined`: Peer was not joined to the room.
- `denied`: Peer was denied to join the room by the host.
- `closedByHost`: Peer was disconnected as the host closed the room.

### Example

**You can access the room state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.**

```jsx
import { useHuddleStore } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

const App = () => {
    const roomId = useHuddleStore(state => state.roomState.roomId);

    return (
        <Component>
            RoomId: {roomId}
            ...
        <Component />
    )
}

```

> **NOTE: Doing this will subscribe `roomId` state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes**. <br />
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
