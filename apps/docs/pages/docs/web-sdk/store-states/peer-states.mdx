# Peers Store States

Peer are the connected users on the same roomId as the current user. They are stored in the `peers` state.
every peer has a `peerId` and a some metadata asscoiated with it.

### Peers Store

It is a object which maps `peerId` with its own asscoiated metadata.

```typescript
type IPeersState = {
    peers: {
        [peerId: string]: IPeerStoreState
    }
}

type IPeerStoreState = {
    peerId: string;
    displayName: string;
    avatarUrl: string;
    isMicPaused: boolean;
    isCamPaused: boolean;
    isSharePaused: boolean;
    isHandRaised: boolean;
    reaction: Reaction;
}
```

> **NOTE:** `peerId` is the unique identifier for a peer. It is generated by the server and is unique for every peer.

### Example

**You can access the room state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.**

```jsx
import { useHuddleStore } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

interface Props {
    peerId: string;
}

const PeerComponent = ({ peerId }) => {
    const isCamPaused = useHuddleStore(state => state.peers[peerId].isCamPaused);

    return (
        <div>
            {isCamPaused ? "Paused" : "Not Paused"}
            ...
        <div />
    )
}

```

> **NOTE: Doing this will subscribe `isCamPaused` state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes**. <br />
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
