# Camera States

If you need to access the `MediaStream` or `CamStream` of the client. These values are exposed in the store for the client.

> **NOTE:** Camera stream for the client is available directly on the store but for the all the peers there streams are available in the `peers` store which needs to be accessed using the `usePeerTrack()` hook.

### Camera Store

```typescript
type IMediaSlice = {
    mediaDevice: MediaDeviceInfo | null;
    stream: MediaStream | null;
    streamError: {
        type: IMediErrorType;
        blocked: boolean;
    } | null;
    deviceLoading: boolean;
    streamsArry: MediaStream[];
}
```

`mediaDevice` - The device that is currently being used for the stream. <br />
`stream` - The stream that is currently being used.<br />
`streamError` - The error that is thrown when the stream is not available.<br />
`deviceLoading` - The loading state of the device.<br />
`streamsArry` - The array of all the streams that are currently being used.<br />

`streamError`

This is the error that is thrown when the stream is not available. The error has two properties `type` and `blocked`.
possible case for this to occur might be if user denied permission to access the camera or if the camera is not available.

> **NOTE:** The `blocked` property is available if any of the error cases occur.

`type` - The type of error that is thrown.<br />

- `NotAllowedError` - The user has denied permission to access the camera.
- `NotFoundError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotReadableError` - The camera is already in use.
- `OverconstrainedError` - The camera is not available.
- `SecurityError` - The camera is not available.
- `AbortError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotSupportedError` - The camera is not available.
- `TypeError` - The camera is not available.

### Example

**You can access the camera state using the `useHuddleStore` hook.**
