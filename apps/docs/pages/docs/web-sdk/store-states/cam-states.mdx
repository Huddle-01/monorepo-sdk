# Camera States

If you need to access the `MediaStream` or `CamStream` of the client. These values are exposed in the store for the client.

> **NOTE:** Camera stream for the client is available directly on the store but for the all the peers there streams are available in the `peers` store which needs to be accessed using the `usePeerTrack()` hook.

### Camera Store

```typescript
type IMediaSlice = {
    mediaDevice: MediaDeviceInfo | null;
    stream: MediaStream | null;
    streamError: {
        type: IMediErrorType;
        blocked: boolean;
    } | null;
    deviceLoading: boolean;
    streamsArry: MediaStream[];
}
```

`mediaDevice` - The device that is currently being used for the stream. <br />
`stream` - The stream that is currently being used.<br />
`streamError` - The error that is thrown when the stream is not available.<br />
`deviceLoading` - The loading state of the device.<br />
`streamsArry` - The array of all the streams that are currently being used.<br />

`streamError`

This is the error that is thrown when the stream is not available. The error has two properties `type` and `blocked`.
possible case for this to occur might be if user denied permission to access the camera or if the camera is not available.

> **NOTE:** The `blocked` property is available if any of the error cases occur.

`type` - The type of error that is thrown.<br />

- `NotAllowedError` - The user has denied permission to access the camera.
- `NotFoundError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotReadableError` - The camera is already in use.
- `OverconstrainedError` - The camera is not available.
- `SecurityError` - The camera is not available.
- `AbortError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotSupportedError` - The camera is not available.
- `TypeError` - The camera is not available.

### Example

**You can access the camera state using the `useMeCamTrack` hook.**

```jsx
import { useHuddleStore, useMeCamTrack } from "huddle01-client/hooks";

interface Props {
    peerId: string;
}

const Component = ({ peerId }) => {
    const isCamPaused = useHuddleStore(state => state.isCamPaused);
    const myCamStream = useMeCamTrack(peerId);

    const getStream = (_track: MediaStreamTrack) => {
        const stream = new MediaStream();
        stream.addTrack(_track);
        return stream;
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        const videoObj = videoRef.current;

        if (videoObj && myCamStream) {
        videoObj.load();
        videoObj.srcObject = getStream(myCamStream);
        videoObj.play().catch(err => {
            logger.error({
            message: 'Error playing video',
            meta: {
                err,
            },
            });
        });
        }

        if (isCamPaused && videoObj) {
        videoObj.pause();
        } else if (!isCamPaused && videoObj) {
        videoObj.play();
        }

        return () => {
            if (videoObj) {
                videoObj?.pause();
                videoObj.srcObject = null;
            }
        };
    }, [myCamStream, isCamPaused]);

    return (
        <div>
            {isCamPaused ? "Paused" : "Not Paused"}
            {isCamPaused ? <video
                ref={videoRef}
                id="peer-video-elem"
                muted
                autoPlay
                playsInline
            /> : null}
            ...
        <div />
    )
}

```

> **NOTE: Doing this will subscribe `isCamPaused`, `myCamStream` state to that component and will re-render the component when the state changes**. <br />
> Pro Tip: You dont need to add useEffect to subscribe to the state and change certains states based on this, it is already done for you.
