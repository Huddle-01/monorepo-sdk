# Mic States

If you need to access the `micStream` of the client user. These values are exposed as a `micStates` property on the client.

### Mic Store

```typescript
type IMicSlice = {
    micState: {
        stream: MediaStream | null;
        mediaDevice: MediaDeviceInfo | null;
        streamError: {
            type: IMediErrorType;
            blocked: boolean;
        } | null;
        deviceLoading: boolean;
    };
    audioDevices: MediaDeviceInfo[]
}
```

`stream` - The current stream of the client user.<br />
`mediaDevice` - The current device that is being used by the client user.<br />
`streamError` - The current error that is being thrown by the client user's microphone.<br />
`deviceLoading` - A boolean that is `true` if the client user's microphone is loading and `false` if it is not.<br />
`audioDevices` - An array of all the audio devices that are available to the client user.<br />

`streamError`

This is the error that is thrown when the stream is not available. The error has two properties `type` and `blocked`.
possible case for this to occur might be if user denied permission to access the microphone or if the microphone is not available.

> **NOTE:** The `blocked` property is available if any of the error cases occur.

`type` - The type of error that is thrown.<br />

- `NotAllowedError` - The user has denied permission to access the camera.
- `NotFoundError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotReadableError` - The camera is already in use.
- `OverconstrainedError` - The camera is not available.
- `SecurityError` - The camera is not available.
- `AbortError` - The camera is not available.
- `NotSupportedError` - The camera is not available.
- `TypeError` - The camera is not available.
