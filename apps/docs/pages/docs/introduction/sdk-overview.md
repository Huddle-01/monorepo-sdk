## SDK Overview

Our SDK gives you the ability to power your application by leveraging the Huddle01 infrastructure. We offers features such as  state management, audio/video media exchange and much more. 

The Huddle01 SDK lets you embed our client methods in your application or clone a sample application using our easy-to-use CLI tool. The SDK can be used with plain JavaScript or any UI framework???? We offer hooks that lets you access all the states in the application. 

## **How to use our SDK?**
